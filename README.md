## Components needed for project
- Arduino Nano
- 5 Buttons of your choice
- Piezo Buzzer
- LDR Sensor
- 3D printed ocarina shell

## Basic idea of project
A 3d printed ocarina will be needed for this project. This print will have room for the installation of:

- A mouthpiece hole (for the installation of the LDR)
- 5 Holes for buttons
- A hole for the piezo buzzer
